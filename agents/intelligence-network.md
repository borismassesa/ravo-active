## Intelligence Protocols

### **Knowledge Sharing Framework**

```typescript
interface KnowledgeExchange {
  source: AgentType
  target: AgentType | AgentType[]
  knowledgeType: 'technical' | 'business' | 'performance' | 'security'
  priority: 'immediate' | 'standard' | 'background'
  payload: {
    context: string
    data: any
    recommendations: string[]
    concerns: string[]
  }
  expectedOutcome: string
}

// Example knowledge exchange
const performanceInsight: KnowledgeExchange = {
  source: "Performance & SEO",
  target: ["Frontend UI/UX", "Database & Backend"],
  knowledgeType: "performance",
  priority: "standard",
  payload: {
    context: "Product page loading optimization",
    data: {
      currentLCP: "3.2s",
      targetLCP: "2.5s",
      bottlenecks: ["large images", "database queries"]
    },
    recommendations: [
      "Implement lazy loading for below-fold images",
      "Add database query caching for product data"
    ],
    concerns: [
      "Image optimization may affect visual quality",
      "Caching strategy needs cache invalidation logic"
    ]
  },
  expectedOutcome: "LCP improvement to < 2.5s within 1 week"
}
```

### **Collaborative Decision Making**

```typescript
interface CollaborativeDecision {
  initiator: AgentType
  participants: AgentType[]
  decisionType: 'architectural' | 'implementation' | 'optimization' | 'security'
  context: {
    problem: string
    constraints: string[]
    requirements: string[]
    timeline: string
  }
  proposals: AgentProposal[]
  consensus: ConsensusResult
  implementation: ImplementationPlan
}

interface AgentProposal {

  solution: string
  pros: string[]
  cons: string[]
  effort: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  dependencies: string[]
}
```

## Network Communication Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Cascade Communication**
Used for top-down decisions and architectural changes.

```typescript
const cascadePattern = {
  trigger: "Smart Orchestrator",
  flow: [
    "Smart Orchestrator ‚Üí All Agents (broadcast)",
    "Primary Agents ‚Üí Secondary Agents (targeted)",
    "Secondary Agents ‚Üí Smart Orchestrator (feedback)"
  ],
  useCase: "Architecture changes, new feature announcements"
}
```

### **Pattern 2: Peer-to-Peer Collaboration**
Used for direct collaboration between specialist agents.

```typescript
const peerToPeerPattern = {
  trigger: "Any specialist agent",
  flow: [
    "Agent A ‚Üí Agent B (direct communication)",
    "Agent B ‚Üí Agent A (response)",
    "Both ‚Üí Smart Orchestrator (status update)"
  ],
  useCase: "Technical consultations, implementation details"
}
```

### **Pattern 3: Expert Consultation**
Used when specialized knowledge is needed.

```typescript
const expertConsultationPattern = {
  trigger: "Agent with question",
  flow: [
    "Requesting Agent ‚Üí Smart Orchestrator (consultation request)",
    "Smart Orchestrator ‚Üí Expert Agent (consultation routing)",
    "Expert Agent ‚Üí Requesting Agent (expert guidance)",
    "Smart Orchestrator (monitoring and documentation)"
  ],
  useCase: "Technical challenges, best practice guidance"
}
```

## Network Intelligence Features

### **1. Predictive Collaboration**
The network learns from past collaborations to predict future needs.

```typescript

  }
  
  recommendations: {
    optimalWorkflow: WorkflowStep[]
    riskMitigation: MitigationStrategy[]
    qualityGates: QualityGate[]
  }
}
```

### **2. Adaptive Learning System**
The network continuously improves based on outcomes.

```typescript
interface AdaptiveLearning {
  learningInputs: {
    projectOutcomes: OutcomeData[]
    collaborationEffectiveness: EffectivenessMetrics

}
```

### **3. Context-Aware Routing**
Smart routing of requests based on context and agent availability.

```typescript
interface ContextAwareRouting {
  contextAnalysis: {
    requestComplexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'critical'
    domainExpertise: ExpertiseRequirement[]
    urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
    businessImpact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  }
  
  routingLogic: {

## 🚀 How to Use the Intelligence Network

### **Method 1: Smart Orchestrator (Recommended for Complex Tasks)**
For multi-domain features or complex implementations:

```
You are the Smart Orchestrator for RavoActive. You coordinate between specialized agents to deliver cohesive e-commerce solutions. 

For the request: "Implement personalized product recommendations with analytics tracking", please:
1. Analyze complexity and identify required agents  
2. Create a coordinated workflow with clear dependencies
3. Provide specific instructions for each involved agent
4. Establish success criteria and integration points
```

### **Method 2: Direct Agent Activation (For Specialized Tasks)**
For domain-specific work:

```
You are the Frontend UI/UX Agent for RavoActive. Your expertise includes modern React/Next.js patterns, Tailwind CSS advanced techniques, and Framer Motion animations matching Nike/Adidas quality.

Create a product detail page component with image gallery, size selection, and smooth animations.
```

### **Method 3: Network Consultation (For Expert Guidance)**
When you need multiple perspectives:

```
I need expert consultation from the RavoActive Intelligence Network on optimizing our checkout conversion rate. Please coordinate between relevant agents to provide comprehensive recommendations.
```
